        <p>I am a 2020 Legend High School grad who played hockey in New York for two years after I graduated before ending up as a Sports Admin major at Northern Colorado Univerity. I enjoy watching sports (mostly hockey, football, and basketball) in which I support the San Jose Sharks, Las Vegas Raiders, and Sacromento Kings. I also enjoy going to breweries and bars with my friends to play pool and darts.</p>
