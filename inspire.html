<h2>What makes a hero?</h2>
<p>A hero is someone that we look up to. A lot of us find this hero in professional athletes. Athletes who are admired for their achievements, character, and impact on not only the sport they play but the community around them. </p>
<p>Patrick Roy revolutionized goaltending with his aggressive style and unmatched competitiveness, making him a symbol of excellence in hockey. His leadership and clutch performances, especially in the playoffs earned him a legendary status. Kids admired him not only for his skill but for his fiery passion and resilience, inspiring young goalies like me to chase their own dreams in the game.</p>
