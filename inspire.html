    <h2>Can professional athletes be heroes?</h2>
    <p>A lot of us find a hero in professional athletes. Athletes who are admired for their achievements, character, and impact on not only the sport they play but the community around them.</p>
    <p>Patrick Roy revolutionized goaltending with his aggressive style and unmatched competitiveness, making him a symbol of excellence in hockey. His leadership and clutch performances, especially in the playoffs, earned him a legendary status. Kids admired him not only for his skill but for his fiery passion and resilience, inspiring young goalies like me to chase their own dreams in the game.</p>
